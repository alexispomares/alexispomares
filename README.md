### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is Alexis. My goal is to blur the frontiers between mind and machine, using **Deep Learning** and **Brain-Computer Interfaces**.

Some interesting repos from my journey so far:

- [Deep Learning classification of EEG responses to multi-dimensional Transcranial Electrical Stimulation](https://github.com/alexispomares/DL-EEG-TES), a.k.a. [DL-EEG-TES](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LB9YoMJ4HiKsqeFQbf2XXOco3DdwnjdF).
- A simple [auditory Oddball Paradigm for EEG/Neurostimulation experimental sessions](https://github.com/alexispomares/auditory-oddball).
- Deep Reinforcement Learning to [play both chess and Clash Royale at superhuman level](https://github.com/alexispomares/deep-reinforcement-learning), based on [_DreamerV3_](https://danijar.com/dreamerv3).
- A [full-body 3D-printed phantom for medical training and research in image-guided surgery](https://github.com/alexispomares/3d-printed-image-guided-surgery).
- A way to [play mobile games using your (ECG) heart rate in real time](https://github.com/alexispomares/space-heart-attack).
- A simple setup to have an [Aleph Zero decentralized validator node running in under an hour](https://github.com/alexispomares/aleph-zero-validator).
- Samantha OS ([pt 1](https://github.com/alexispomares/samantha-OS-pt1) and [pt 2](https://github.com/alexispomares/samantha-OS-pt2)), a WIP to eventually have a human-level LLM use my computer for me, based on [_OpenInterpreter_](https://twitter.com/hellokillian/status/1699156860073640038).
- Testing the current limits for [LLMs to accurately simulate human behavior](https://github.com/alexispomares/the-truman-show), based on [_Generative Agents_](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1689315683958652928).
<!--- - [Procedural music generation to induce desirable mental states](https://github.com/alexispomares/zone.music) (focus, creativity, sleep), inspired by _[Brain.fm](https://brain.fm/science)'s_ EEG studies. -->
